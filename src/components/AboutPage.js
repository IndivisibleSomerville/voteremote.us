                    <p>Tens of thousands of students live outside of their home states during election season. In a country full of confusing absentee voter rules, students often skip voting entirely.</p>
                    <p>Vote Remote helps students living on campuses get their votes in and counted.</p>
                    <p>As a voter engagement tool, Vote Remote leverages tech and real-life support to absentee and mail-in voters in high school, college, and graduate school. Vote Remote’s unique blend of web tools and personal outreach ensures that voters are registered, informed about their district’s absentee voting requirements, and ready to meet deadlines.</p>
                    <p>Even if you’re already registered, signing up for Vote Remote will provide you with reminders, IRL support, and access to your campus’s VR community.</p>
